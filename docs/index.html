      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Web design and development changed a lot in the last twenty+ years and
        the rate of change does not seem to going to slow down. From very small
        and simple it is grown to be a huge field with several specializations.
        But you can still go a long way by simple means and only dive down into
        complexity when you need it.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hope is to help you to get started. Don't let get yourself
        overwhelmed by the amount there is to learn. There is always a lot you
        don't know yet, even for me doing this for two decades.
